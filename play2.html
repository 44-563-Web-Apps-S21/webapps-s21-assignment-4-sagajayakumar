    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Why, sir, I know her not.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet knowest her not?</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Is she not hard-favoured, sir?</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Sir, I know that well enough.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>What dost thou know?</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>That's because the one is painted and the other out of all count.
    </p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>How painted? and how out of count?</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.</p>
