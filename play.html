    <h2>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</h2>
    <h3>Act 2 - SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.</h3>
    <h4 class="desc">The Two Gentlemen of Verona tells the story of two devoted friends, Valentine and Proteus. Valentine leaves their home city of Verona for Milan, but Proteus, in love with Julia, stays behind. Then Proteus's father sends him to Milan, too. Before leaving,
        Proteus pledges his love to Julia.</h4>
    <p class="direction">Enter VALENTINE and SPEED</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Sir, your glove.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Not mine; my gloves are on.</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine: Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine! Ah, Silvia, Silvia!</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>How now, sirrah?</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>She is not within hearing, sir.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Why, sir, who bade you call her?</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Well, you'll still be too forward.</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <P>Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?</P>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>She that your worship loves?</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <P>Why, how know you that I am in love?</P>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
        lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock;
        when you walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look on you, I can hardly think you my
        master.
    </p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Are all these things perceived in me?</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>They are all perceived without ye.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>Without me? they cannot.</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you were so simple, none else would: but you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician
        to comment on your malady.</p>
    <h4 class="valentine">VALENTINE</h4>
    <p>But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?</p>
    <h4 class="speed">SPEED</h4>
    <p>She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?</p>
